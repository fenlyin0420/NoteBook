#  transformation

##  model
- Linner transformation (**Affine** transformations)
	- rotation
	- scaling
- special case(not a linner transform)
	- translation

### unified way to transform
**Homogenous Coordinates**
unified affine transformation and translation transformation.

- vector + vector = vector
- point - point = vector
- point + vector = vector
- point + point = midpoint


transform order is important! compex transform consists of simple transform.

multiple transforme matrix can be composed to optimized performance.(associative-law)
##  view
- projection

- Define the camera first
	- Position
	- gaze direction
	- up direction
