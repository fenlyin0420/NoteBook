”Select Link To From Scene” This button is used to link your selected atom to another atom within the scene.  
  
This is the primary way to hierarchy link within VaM.  
  
Clicking this button will switch all available atoms to semi transparent spheres.  
  
Clicking on one of them will link your atom.
